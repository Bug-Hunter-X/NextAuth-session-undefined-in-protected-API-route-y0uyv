## NextAuth Session Undefined in Protected API Route

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using NextAuth.js with protected API routes: the session object is unexpectedly undefined even when the user is logged in. This usually happens due to improper usage or configuration of the `unstable_getServerSession` function.

### Problem:
The provided code snippet attempts to access the NextAuth session within a protected API route. However, under certain circumstances, the `session` variable remains undefined, leading to unexpected behavior and authentication failures.

### Solution:
The solution involves correctly configuring the `unstable_getServerSession` function, ensuring the necessary options, such as `secret`, `providers`, and `callbacks` (if any are implemented) are appropriately provided, to effectively get a user session.
